# Workout-Tracker

With this app, you can crete, or update workouts and it displays the information in different charts. If you would like to see a deployed version of this app, follow the link here: https://quiet-fortress-04167.herokuapp.com/?id=5e6d0278f48be000174aa6d9

The purpose behind building this app was to set up routes to manipulate a Mongo Database. The front end of this app was provided to me, but I was tasked with writing the server and routes myself. The HTML routes are for guiding the user to each of the HTML pages, and the API routes are for manipulating the database. 

While this app does not have full CRUD capabilities, I learned a lot about updating specific parts of a Mongo Database.
